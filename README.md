# Employee Summary

## Description
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles


## Usage
This app is designed to allow the user to build an employee database which is rendered to an HTML page. The user must first install all necessary packages, which are provided via the app.js file. When running this app in the terminal, the user is first prompted to choose which type of employee they would like to add to their database: Manager, Engineer, or Intern. Once the choice is made, a series of questions will display one by one for the user to enter information on chosen employee. Once all information is input, it is rendered to an HTML page and displayed in a user friendly window. 

## Deploy

### Disclaimer
Unforuntately I was unable to complete this assignment on my own. I was able to get the first prompt to display but was unable to succeed further. I hope to perfect this at a later date when I have a better understanding of node.
